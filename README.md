# Implementation of PCA (Principal Components Analysis) using Jupyter Notebook
The dataset used (breast_cancer) was imported from scikit-learn library as well as the PCA itself.

PCA is a famous dimensionality-reduction algorithm which helps in simplyfing our data by finding the "principal components" that holds the most variance in the data. Our data is then transposed on to these components.
